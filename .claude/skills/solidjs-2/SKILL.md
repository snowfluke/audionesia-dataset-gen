description: SolidJS 2.0 (release candidate) API, migration rules from 1.x, and this repo's Solid conventions. Use this skill whenever you write, edit, or review any .tsx or .ts file under src/ in this project, any Solid component, signal, memo, effect, store, async data read, worker client, or feature store, and whenever a Solid 1.x name appears (createResource, createAsync, onMount, on, batch, mergeProps, splitProps, unwrap, Suspense, ErrorBoundary, solid-js/web, solid-js/store). Also use it for questions about Solid 2.0 behaviour, flush timing, Loading and Errored boundaries, or eslint-plugin-solid v2 findings.

# SolidJS 2.0 in this repo

Solid 2.0 is a release candidate (`solid-js@2.0.0-rc.3`, `@solidjs/web@2.0.0-rc.3`, `@solidjs/vite-plugin@3.0.0-next.34`, verified 2026-08-27 at https://v2.solidjs.com). It is not a small bump from 1.x: DOM rendering moved to `@solidjs/web`, stores moved into `solid-js`, writes apply on a microtask flush, effects take two functions, and async data is a plain memo that returns a promise. Training data mostly knows 1.x, so check every Solid call against this skill before trusting memory. `eslint-plugin-solid` (v2 rules) runs under oxlint and rejects the 1.x names; the type checker rejects most of the rest.

## When to read which file

| Need | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Exact 2.0 signatures, imports, and copy-paste examples | `references/api.md` |
| tsconfig, JSX typing gotchas, lint rule meanings and how to satisfy them | `references/typescript-and-lint.md` |
| How this codebase structures stores, views, workers, and async reads | `references/project-patterns.md` |

## The rules that change how you write code

1. **Imports.** `render` and DOM `JSX` types come from `@solidjs/web`; everything reactive (`createSignal`, `createMemo`, `createEffect`, `createStore`, `Show`, `For`, `Loading`, `Errored`, `merge`, `omit`, `flush`) comes from `solid-js`. `solid-js/web` and `solid-js/store` do not resolve.
2. **Writes apply later.** `setCount(1); count()` still returns the old value until the microtask flush. Never read a signal right after setting it and expect the new value; in tests call `flush()`.
3. **Effects are two functions.** `createEffect(compute, effect)`: `compute` reads signals and returns a value, `effect(next, prev)` runs the side effect untracked and may return a cleanup. A single-argument `createEffect` throws `MISSING_EFFECT_FN` at runtime. `onMount`, `on`, and `batch` are gone; for a one-shot at construction, call the function in the component body.
4. **Async is a memo.** `createMemo(async () => ...)` is the only async primitive; read it like a value inside `<Loading fallback>`, catch rejections with `<Errored fallback={(error, reset) => ...}>`. `createResource` and `createAsync` do not exist. Re-run by changing a signal the memo reads; this repo bumps a `version` signal after writes.
5. **Props stay reactive.** Never destructure props. Defaults through `merge(defaults, props)`, forwarding through `omit(props, "a", "b")`, and capture the result in a variable before spreading. Pass values to DOM attributes (`value={name()}`), never accessors.
6. **Stores mutate drafts.** `setState((draft) => { draft.a.b = value; })`. `unwrap` is now `snapshot` and returns a deep copy.
7. **`class` is structured.** `class={[BASE, VARIANTS[v], { "text-kumo-danger": bad() }]}`; no hand-built strings.
8. **Owners matter.** `createMemo`, `createEffect`, and `onCleanup` need an owner. Module-level code may create signals only. Anything with memos or cleanup lives in a `create<Feature>Store()` factory called from the view component.

## Quick migration table

| Solid 1.x | Solid 2.0 |
| --- | --- |
| `import { render } from "solid-js/web"` | `import { render } from "@solidjs/web"` |
| `import { createStore } from "solid-js/store"` | `import { createStore } from "solid-js"` |
| `jsxImportSource: "solid-js"` | `jsxImportSource: "@solidjs/web"` |
| `createEffect(() => { ... })` | `createEffect(() => deps(), (deps) => { ... })` |
| `onMount(fn)` | call `fn()` in the component body |
| `on(dep, fn)` / `batch(fn)` | removed; use two-argument effects; writes batch by default |
| `createResource(src, fetcher)` / `createAsync(fn)` | `createMemo(async () => fetcher(src()))` |
| `<Suspense fallback>` | `<Loading fallback on={value}>` |
| `<ErrorBoundary fallback={(e, reset) => ...}>` | `<Errored fallback={(error, reset) => ...}>` (`error` is an accessor) |
| `mergeProps(a, b)` / `splitProps(p, keys)` | `merge(a, b)` / `omit(p, ...keys)` |
| `setState("a", "b", v)` | `setState((draft) => { draft.a.b = v; })` (`storePath` exists; do not use it) |
| `unwrap(store)` | `snapshot(store)` |
| `aria-selected={bool}` | `aria-selected={bool ? "true" : "false"}` |

## Verification

Run `bun run type-check && bun run lint` after any Solid change; both catch most 1.x leftovers. Behaviour that depends on flush timing, workers, or the DOM is checked by `bun run smoke` against `bun run dev`, not by unit tests.
